A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY</p>
    <img src="drop-cap-w.png" alt="W"> <p>hen Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday 
        with a party of special magnificence, there was 
        much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.</p>
       <p>
        Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, 
        ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back 
        from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old 
        folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that 
        was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it 
        seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine 
        they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that 
        shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess 
        (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.</p>
